# Deep Learning Image Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on building, training, and evaluating deep learning models for image classification. It implements and compares **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, analyzing their performance through standardized metrics and visualizations.

The repository showcases practical skills in model design, training workflows, evaluation, and result interpretation.
